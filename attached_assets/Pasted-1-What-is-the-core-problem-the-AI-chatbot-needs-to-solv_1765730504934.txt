1. What is the core problem the AI chatbot needs to solve?

The core problem is that the traditional generic drug market is economically broken, leading to:

Extreme price-based competition (“race to the bottom”)

Unsustainably low profit margins for manufacturers

Manufacturer exits and critical drug shortages

A system that discourages innovation and long-term stability

Instead of helping users buy generics, the AI system is designed to solve the upstream R&D and business-development problem:

👉 Identifying high-value drug repurposing and Value-Added Medicine (VAM) opportunities that are scientifically plausible, commercially profitable, and legally defensible.

In short:

The chatbot’s purpose is not consumer assistance, but to automate pharma R&D and BD decision-making by generating investable drug repurposing cases, not just ideas.

2. Who are the target users and what tasks should the chatbot help them accomplish?
🎯 Target Users

According to the deck, the target users are enterprise-level pharmaceutical stakeholders, not patients:

Pharmaceutical Business Development (BD) teams

R&D strategy teams

Investment and licensing decision-makers

IP and market access professionals

Strategic pharma partners evaluating pipelines

🧠 Tasks the chatbot should help them accomplish

The chatbot should act as an AI “Deal Team”, helping users to:

Identify promising drug repurposing candidates

Evaluate scientific plausibility (mechanism, target, indication fit)

Analyze commercial viability (market size, pricing potential, competition)

Assess IP defensibility (patents, exclusivity, method-of-use claims)

Generate investment-grade reports automatically

Prioritize opportunities using a quantitative scoring framework (MCDA)

This mirrors the role of:

Bioinformatics experts + market analysts + patent lawyers working together

3. What key features should the chatbot have?

Based on Project Chimera’s design, the chatbot should include the following features:

🔑 Core Functional Features

Automated Hypothesis Generation

Suggests new drug–indication pairings using scientific literature and clinical data

Multi-Agent Reasoning

Separate AI agents acting as:

Bioinformatics Expert

Market Analyst

Patent/IP Lawyer

Viability & Defensibility Scorecard (MCDA)

Scores every opportunity on three axes:

Plausible? (Scientific)

Profitable? (Commercial)

Defensible? (IP)

Knowledge Graph–Driven Search

Uses a Pharma-Commercial Knowledge Graph (PC-KG) combining:

Scientific literature

Patent data

Market and sales data

Auditable & Explainable Outputs

Transparent, traceable workflows (LangGraph)

Human-in-the-loop checkpoints for regulated environments

Investment-Ready Reporting

Produces concise, professional-grade reports suitable for BD and investment decisions

The system “doesn’t find ideas — it generates investment cases.”

4. Do you have any branding preferences for the website?

Yes — the branding is implicitly defined in the presentation:

🧬 Brand Identity

Product Name: Project Chimera

Tone: Serious, analytical, enterprise-grade

Industry: Pharma, biotech, AI-driven R&D

Style:

Clean

Data-driven

Minimalist

Trust-focused (suitable for regulated environments)

🎨 Visual Direction (Inferred)

Muted, professional colors (e.g., deep blue, slate, grey, white)

Graphs, scorecards, decision matrices

Emphasis on credibility, transparency, and precision

This is not a consumer health brand — it is positioned as deep-tech infrastructure for pharma strategy.

5. What type of AI capabilities are envisioned?

The presentation clearly outlines advanced, enterprise-grade AI capabilities, including:

🤖 Core AI Capabilities

Natural Language Reasoning

Understands scientific, legal, and commercial queries

Synthesizes unstructured data into structured insights

Multi-Agent AI System

Specialized LLM agents collaborate autonomously

Each agent reasons within its domain expertise

Knowledge Graph Reasoning

Traverses relationships between drugs, targets, indications, patents, and markets

Decision Intelligence

Uses Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)

Produces objective, algorithm-driven scores

Explainable & Auditable AI

Traceable workflows

Suitable for regulated pharma environments

Supports human oversight

Guided, End-to-End Workflows

From hypothesis → analysis → scoring → investment decision

The AI functions as a fully automated R&D and BD deal team, not a simple chatbot.
